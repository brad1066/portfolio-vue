# Portfolio Application using Vue
*by Bradley Hastings*

This is a Vue.js application that will be used to host the vue applications that make up my portfolio. As well as this, it will have links and descriptions about other projects and sites that I have made. For all projects, a link to the repo will be provided.

For any Vue application in my portfolio, the app will be possible to view from within the portfolio
